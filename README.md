This repo was really just a combination of lazyness and efficiency.

Instead of creating two seperate repo's I just created one. Is this lazy? Yes. Is this effecient? also, yes.

So far this repo contains:
GunKockBackGame (project)
and
Datastruct and algo excersizes (class)

# [](#header-1)GunKockBackGame
This was a fun game to program. This game was the first real game I worked on in unity. (Summer game project was techicly first but the amount of progress we made in that makes it negligable)
The core concept of this game was a bullet hell game in which the only (major) method of movement was firing your weapons.

The player in the center surrouneded by enemies.

For this game I still intend to write out a post mortem which will be added here once it is done.

Find (slightly broken) builds of the game [HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12pVm9czWafH-riXYUVewahrFci0iRxuk).

# [](#header-1)Datastruct and algo excersizes
This doc contains three different excersizes that I all wrote solo(officialy I was working toghter with Mark Griekspoor, however this student never submitted any work...). Each of these were simple exceriszes passed down by the teacher. These assignements are also included in the folder for ease of use and readabilty of the repo for other users. This also ensures that I won't lose the .pdf's when I leave the HvA.

The PDF documents speak for themselves here.
